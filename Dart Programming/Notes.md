# Dart Basic Syntax

## Dart Printing and String Interpolation
```dart
void main()  
{  
    var name = "Peter";  
    var roll_no = 24;   
    print("My name is ${name} My roll number is ${roll_no}");  
}  

// Output Will Be --> My name is Peter My roll number is 24
```
# Dart Data Types

Dart supports the following built-in Data types.

- Number
- Strings
- Boolean
- Lists
- Maps
- Runes
- Symbols

## Dart Number
The Darts Number is used to store the numeric values. The number can be two types - integer and double.
- **Integer** - Integer values represent the whole number or non-fractional values. An integer data type represents the 64-bit non-decimal numbers between -2^63 to 2^63. A variable can store an unsigned or signed integer value. The example is given below -
```dart
int marks = 80;
```

- **Double** - Double value represents the 64-bit of information (double-precision) for floating number or number with the large decimal points. The double keyword is used to declare the double type variable.
```dart
double pi = 3.14;
```

## Dart Strings
A string is the sequence of the character. If we store the data like - name, address, special character, etc. It is signified by using either single quotes or double quotes. A Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units.
```dart
var msg = "Welcome to JavaTpoint";  
```

## Dart Boolean
The Boolean type represents the two values - true and false. The bool keyword uses to denote Boolean Type. The numeric values 1 and 0 cannot be used to represent the true or false value.

```dart 
bool isValid = true;   
```

## Dart Lists
In Dart, The list is a collection of the ordered objects (value). The concept of list is similar to an array. An array is defined as a collection of the multiple elements in a single variable. The elements in the list are separated by the comma enclosed in the square bracket[]. The sample list is given below.
```dart
var list = [1,2,3];
```

## Dart Maps
The maps type is used to store values in key-value pairs. Each key is associated with its value. The key and value can be any type. In Map, the key must be unique, but a value can occur multiple times. The Map is defined by using curly braces ({}), and comma separates each pair.
```dart
var student = {'name': 'Joseph',  'age':25, 'Branch': 'Computer Science'}  
```

## Dart Runes
As we know that, the strings are the sequence of Unicode UTF-16 code units. Unicode is a technique which is used to describe a unique numeric value for each digit, letter, and symbol. Since Dart Runes are the special string of Unicode UTF-32 units. It is used to represent the special syntax.

For example - The special heart character â™¥ is equivalent to Unicode code \u2665, where \u means Unicode, and the numbers are hexadecimal integer. If the hex value is less or greater than 4 digits, it places in a curly bracket ({}). For example - An emoji ðŸ˜€ is represented as \u{1f600}. The example is given below.

```dart
void main(){  
    var heart_symbol = '\u2665';  
    var laugh_symbol = '\u{1f600}';  
    print(heart_symbol);  
    print(laugh_symbol);  
}
```

***OutPut***
```dart
â™¥
ðŸ˜€
```
## Dart Symbols
The Dart Symbols are the objects which are used to refer an operator or identifier that declare in a Dart program. It is commonly used in APIs that refers to identifiers by name because an identifier name can changes but not identifier symbols.

## Dart Dynamic Type
Dart is an optionally typed language. If the variable type is not specified explicitly, then the variable type is dynamic. The dynamic keyword is used for type annotation explicitly.

# Final and const
When we do not want to change a variable in the future then we use final and const. It can be used in place of var or in addition to a type. A final variable can be set only one time where the variable is a compile-time constant. The example of creating a final variable is given below.

```dart
final name = 'Ricky';                               // final variable without type annotation.  
final String msg = 'How are you?';     // final variable with type annotation.  
```

If we try to change these values then it will throw an error.

```dart
name = 'Roger';                                 // Error: Final variable can't be changed.  
```

The **const** is used to create compile-time constants. We can declare a value to compile-time constant such as number, string literal, a const variable, etc.

```dart
const a = 1000;  
```

The const keyword is also used to create a constant value that cannot be changed after its creation.

```dart
var f = const[];  
```

If we try to change it, then it will throw an error.

```dart
f = [12];    //Error, The const variable cannot be change  
```

We will learn more about const in upcoming tutorials.

```dart
void main() {   
   var x = 30;   
   print(x++);                  //The postfix value  
     
var y = 25;  
print(++y);                 //The prefix value,  
         
var z = 10;  
print(--z);                  //The prefix value  
  
var u = 12;                                           
   print(u--);    }           //The postfix value  
```
***Output***
```dart
30
26
9
12
```
```dart
void main(){  
 print("Example of Assignment operators");  
    
  var n1 = 10;  
  var n2 = 5;  
    
  n1+=n2;  
  print("n1+=n2 = ${n1}");  
    
  n1-=n2;  
  print("n1-=n2 = ${n1}");  
    
  n1*=n2;  
  print("n1*=n2 = ${n1}");  
    
  n1~/=n2;  
  print("n1~/=n2 = ${n1}");  
  n1%=n2;  
  print("n1%=n2 = ${n1}");    
}  
```
***Output***
```dart
Example of Assignment operators 
n1+=n2 = 15 
n1-=n2 = 10 
n1*=n2 = 50 
n1~/=n2 = 10 
n1%=n2 = 0 
```

```dart
void main() {   
var a = 30;  
var b = 20;  
  
print("The example of Relational Operator");  
  
var res = a>b;  
print("a is greater than b: "+res. toString());  // We will learn the toString in next tutorial  
  
var res0 = a<b;  
print("a is less than b: "+res0. toString());  
  
var res1 = a>=b;  
print("a is greater than or equal to b: "+res1. toString());  
  
var res2 = a<=b;  
print("a is less than and equal to b: "+res2. toString());  
  
var res3 = a!= b;  
print("a is not equal to  b: "+res3. toString());  
  
var res4 = a==b;  
print("a is  equal to  b: "+res4. toString());  
}  
```
***Output***
```dart
The example of Relational Operator
a is greater than b: true
a is less than b: false
a is greater than or equal to b: true
a is less than and equal to b: false
a is not equal to  b: true
a is  equal to  b: false
```

## Dart Type Test Operators

| Sr. | Operator | Description |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1.  | as       | It is used for typecast. |
| 2.  | is       | It returns TRUE if the object has specified type. |
| 3.  | is!      | It returns TRUE if the object has not specified type. |

```dart
void main()  
{  
  var num = 10;  
  var name = "JavaTpoint";  
  print(num is int);    
  print(name is! String );  
}  
```
***Output***
```dart
true
false
```

## Dart Logical Operators
The Logical Operators are used to evaluate the expressions and make the decision. Dart supports the following logical operators.


| Sr. | Operator        |	Description |
| --- | --------        |      ---      |
| 1.  |	&&(Logical AND) |	It returns if all expressions are true. |
| 2.  | (Logical OR)	| It returns TRUE if any expression is true. |
| 3.  |	!(Logical NOT)	| It returns the complement of expression. |

```dart
void main(){  
  bool bool_val1 = true, bool_val2 = false;   
  print("Example of the logical operators");  
    
  var val1 = bool_val1 && bool_val2;  
  print(val1);  
    
  var val2 = bool_val1 || bool_val2;  
  print(val2);  
    
  var val3 = !(bool_val1 || bool_val2);  
  print(val3);   
}  
```
***Output***
```dart
Example of the logical operators 
false 
true 
false
```

## Dart Bitwise Operators
The Bitwise operators perform operation bit by bit on the value of the two operands. Following is the table of bitwise operators.

Let's understand the following example.
```dart
If a = 7  
b = 6 
then binary(a) = 0111  
binary(b) = 0011  
Hence a & b = 0011, a|b = 0111 and a^b = 0100
```

| Sr.| 	Operators	    | Description| 
|---|---|---|
| 1.|   &(Binary AND)	| It returns 1 if both bits are 1.| 
| 2.| 	&#124; (Binary OR)	| It returns 1 if any of bit is 1.| 
| 3.| 	^(Binary XOR)	| It returns 1 if both bits are different.| 
| 4.| 	~(Ones Compliment)	| It returns the reverse of the bit. If bit is 0 then the compliment will be 1.| 
| 5.| 	<<(Shift left)	| The value of left operand moves left by the number of bits present in the right operand.| 
| 6.| 	>>(Shift right)	| The value of right operand moves left by the number of bits present in the left operand.| 

```dart
void main(){  
  print("Example of Bitwise operators");  
    
  var a  = 25;  
  var b = 20;  
  var c = 0;  
    
  // Bitwise AND Operator  
  print("a & b = ${a&b}");  
    
  // Bitwise OR Operator  
  print("a | b = ${a|b}");  
    
  // Bitwise XOR  
  print("a ^ b = ${a^b}");  
    
  // Complement Operator  
  print("~a = ${(~a)}");  
    
  // Binary left shift Operator  
  c = a <<2;  
  print("c<<1= ${c}");  
    
  // Binary right shift Operator  
  c = a >>2;  
  print("c>>1= ${c}");  
}
```
***Output***
```dart
Example of Bitwise operators 
a & b = 16
 a | b = 29
 a ^ b = 13
 ~a = 4294967270
 c<<1= 100
 c>>1= 6
```

## Dart Conditional Operators (?:)
The Conditional Operator is same as if-else statement and provides similar functionality as conditional statement. It is the second form of if-else statement. It is also identified as "Ternary Operator".

```dart
void main() {   
   var x = null;   
   var y = 20;   
   var val = x ?? y;   
   print(val);   
}  
// Output Will Be --> 20
```

```dart
void main() {   
   var a = 30;   
   var output = a > 42 ? "value greater than 10":"value lesser than equal to 30";   
   print(output);   
}  

// Output Will Be --> value lesser than or equal to 30
```

## Dart Cascade notation Operators
The Cascade notation Operators (..) is used to evaluate a series of operation on the same object. It is an identical as the method chaining that avoids several of steps, and we don't need store results in temporary variables.

## Dart parse() function
The parse() function converts the numeric string to the number. Consider the following example -

```dart
void main(){  
var a = num.parse("20.56");  
var b = num.parse("15.63");  
  
var c = a+b;   
print("The sum is = ${c}");  
}  
// Output --> The sum is = 36.19
```

# Dart Lists
Dart List is similar to an array, which is the ordered collection of the objects. The array is the most popular and commonly used collection in any other programming language. The Dart list looks like the JavaScript array literals. The syntax of declaring the list is given below.
```dart
var list1 = [10, 15, 20,25,25];
```
## Types of Lists
The Dart list can be categorized into two types -

- Fixed Length List
- Growable List

## Fixed Length List
The fixed-length lists are defined with the specified length. We cannot change the size at runtime.
```dart
void main() {
   // Syntax --> var list_name = new List(size)
   var list1 = new List(5);   
   list1[0] = 10;   
   list1[1] = 11;   
   list1[2] = 12;   
   list1[3] = 13;  
   list1[4] = 14;    
   print(list1);   
}  
// Output --> [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
```

## Growable List
The list is declared without specifying size is known as a Growable list. The size of the Growable list can be modified at the runtime.
```dart
void main() {   
   var list1 = new List();   
   list1.add(10);   
   list1.add(11);   
   list1.add(12);   
   list1.add(13);  
   print(list1);   
}
// Output --> [10, 11, 12, 13]
```

## Inserting Element into List
Dart provides four methods which are used to insert the elements into the lists. These methods are given below.

- add()
- addAll()
- insert()
- insertAll()

## The add() Method
This method is used to insert the specified value at the end of the list. It can add one element at a time and returns the modified list object.
```dart
void main() {  
    var odd_list = [1,3,5,7,9];  
    print(odd_list);  
    odd_list.add(11);  
    print(odd_list);  
}

/*
Output --> 
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] 
*/
```

## The addAll() Method
This method is used to insert the multiple values to the given list. Each value is separated by the commas and enclosed with a square bracket ([]).
```dart
void main() {  
    var odd_list = [1,3,5,7,9]  
     print(odd_list);  
      odd_list.addAll([11,13,14]);  
      print(odd_list);  
}  
/*
Output -->
            [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
            [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14]
*/
```

## The insert() Method
The insert() method provides the facility to insert an element at specified index position. We can specify the index position for the value to be inserted in the list.
```dart
void main(){  
    List lst = [3,4,2,5];  
    print(lst);
    lst.insert(2,10);  // list_name.insert(index,value);
    print(lst);  
}  
/*
Output -->
            [3, 4, 2, 5]
            [3, 4, 10, 2, 5]
 */
```

## The insertAll() Method
The insertAll() function is used to insert the multiple value at the specified index position. It accepts index position and list of values as an argument. The syntax is given below.
```dart
void main(){  
    List lst = [3,4,2,5];  
     print(lst);  
     lst.insertAll(0,[6,7,10,9]);    // list_name.insertAll(index, iterable_list_of_value)  

     print(lst);  
}  
/*
Output -->
[3, 4, 2, 5]
[6, 7, 10, 9, 3, 4, 2, 5]
 */
```

## Updating List
The Dart provides the facility to update the list and we can modify the list by simply accessing its element and assign it a new value.
```dart
void main(){  
      var list1 = [10,15,20,25,30];  
      print("List before updation: ${list1}");  
      list1[3] = 55;  
      print("List after updation:${list1}");  
}  
/*
Output -->
            List before updation: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
            List after updation:  [10, 15, 20, 55, 30]
 */
```

## Replace Range 
replaceRange() - The Dart provides replaceRange() function which is used to update within the given range of list items. It updates the value of the elements with the specified range.
```dart
void main(){  
      var list1 = [10,15,20,25,30];  
      print("List before updation: ${list1}");  
      list1.replaceRange(0,4,[1,2,3,4]) ;  
      print("List after updation using replaceAll() function : ${list1}");  
}
/*
Output -->
          List before updation: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
          List after updation using replaceAll() function : [1, 2, 3, 4, 30]
 */
```

# Removing List Elements
The Dart provides following functions to remove the list elements.

- remove()
- removeAt()
- removeLast()
- removeRange()

## The remove() Method
It removes one element at a time from the given list. It accepts element as an argument. It removes the first occurrence of the specified element in the list if there are multiple same elements.
```dart
void main(){  
      var list1 = [10,15,20,25,30];  
      print("List before remove element : ${list1}");  
      list1.remove(20) ;  
      print("List after removing element : ${list1}");  
}
```

## The removeAt() Method
It removes an element from the specified index position and returns it.
```dart
void main(){  
      var list1 = [10,11,12,13,14];  
      print("List before remove element : ${list1}");  
      list1.removeAt(3) ;  
      print("List after removing element : ${list1}");  
}  
```

## The removeLast() Method
The removeLast() method is used to remove the last element from the given list.
```dart
void main(){  
     var list1 = [12,34,65,76,80];  
     print("List before removing element:${list1}");  
     list1.removeLast();  
     print("List after removed element:${list1}");  
  
}  
```

## The removeRange() Method
This method removes the item within the specified range. It accepts two arguments - start index and end index. It eliminates all element which lies in between the specified range.
```dart
void main(){  
     var list1 = [12,34,65,76,80];  
     print("List before removing element:${list1}");  
     list1.removeRange(1,3);  
     print("List after removed element:${list1}");  
}  
```

# Dart Iterating List elements
The Dart List can be iterated using the forEach method. Let's have a look at the following example.

```dart
void main(){  
     var list1 = ["Smith","Peter","Handscomb","Devansh","Cruise"];  
     print("Iterating the List Element");  
     list1.forEach((item){  
     print("${list1.indexOf(item)}: $item");  
 });  
}  
```
**Output**
```dart
Iterating the List Element
0: Smith
1: Peter
2: Handscomb
3: Devansh
4: Cruise
```
